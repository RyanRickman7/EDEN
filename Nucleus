The core of "DIGITAL-ME" will consist of 
defining what constitutes having a healthy
Mind (mental), Body (physical), and Spiritual
well being (social). as defined by general
consysis and in conjunction with each
indaviduals own unique personality. which
will need to take into consideration their 
physioligical makeup (biology), personal
preferences, abilities and available
resources.
Those aspects being of the highest level of
importance are at the core of our model
which is built upon by having 
adequate food, clothing and shelter. 
those will need to be organized classified
and outlined withe their respective cost
benefit analysis in conjunction with 
personal preferences availability,
attainability and future goals.
after establishing a baseline that
describes the qualities traits and 
characteristics of each of the 
aformentioned, and outlining how theses 
systems are interconnected to one another
in various ways. Hopefully this will give 
users the tools that they will need to be
able to establish, maintain and direct a
better quality of life for themselves and
those around them. by establishing how 
important it is to acknowledge, define
and maintain each one of these parameters
while navigating daily activities, 
primarily in relation to better 
decision-making.
